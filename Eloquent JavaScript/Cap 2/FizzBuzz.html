      <h3>FizzBuzz</h3>
      <p>
        Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to
        100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
        instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print
        "Buzz" instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" ,
        for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz"
        or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those). (This is actually
        an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant
        percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your labor
        market value just went up.)
