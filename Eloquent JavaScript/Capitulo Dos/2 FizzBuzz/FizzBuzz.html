      <p>
        Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to
        100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
        instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print
        "Buzz" instead.
      </p>

        (This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed
        out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved
        it, your labor market value just went up.)
